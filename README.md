# PRF192 - ASSIGNMENT: CONTACT KEEPER

## So far, you've been learning the C programing language about two weeks. Now is the right time to think about your assignment.This semester, your task is to write a C program, namely Contact Keeper, to manage your contacts easily and effectively.

### One contact should have the following features:
	1. First Name
	2. Last Name
	3. Company
	4. Phone Number
 	5. Email
 	6. Working Address
 	7. Home Address
 	8. Birthday
 
### Data validation should be implemented, for example:
 	1. Phone Number should be a integer number of 9 or 10 digits
 	2. Bithday should be in the DD/MM/YYYY format 
 
### Your program should have at least six functions:
	1. Add new contact
	2. Edit contact
 	3. Delete contact (by name or phone number)
 	4. Search contact (by name or phone number)
	5. List all contacts with birthdays in a given month (sort by date)
 	6. List all contacts in the table format (sort by name)
 
### The contact information should be permanently stored in a text file so that when the program starts all contacts could be loaded automatically.
